### Interests

Apart from my career as a web developer, I enjoy spending quality time with friends and family trying out new things and also playing competitive video games with friends online.

I'm also very interested in self hosting solutions. My FreeNAS home server houses Nextcloud for personal cloud storage, a Plex Media Server for on-the-go media consumption, a MineOS Minecraft server, and block storage to store backups for all the computers in my life.

A favorite hobby of mine is photography. I enjoy taking pictures of family and friends, street photography, and professional portraits. At UIUC I covered a few sporting events and shows for the Daily Illini. Immediately after high school I was hired to be a product photographer for a large showroom.  I often take pictures on demand of people, products, or places as needed for projects and clients.

Currently streaming Stranger Things, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Brooklyn Nine Nine, and True Detective.

Favorite topics in podcasts and YouTube videos are personal wealth, self improvement, technology news, and video game related content.
